# MLP
C++ code that I wrote about 20 years ago modelling an n-layer MLP Neural Network.

This code was part of another project...; however, wanted to put just the NN part here, just in case someone wants to refer it (quite unlikely but).
These were the days where these neurons were hand-coded, assembled into an NN_Layer class.
It used most of the hyperparamerts like Bias, Alpha, Momentum...; and gave ~90% accuracy of my OCR application that used this engine.
